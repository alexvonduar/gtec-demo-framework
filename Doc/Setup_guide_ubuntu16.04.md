# Setup guide Ubuntu 16.04

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu16.04 64 bit
- Build tools and xrand
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libxrandr-dev
    ```
- Python 3.4+
  To be able run python scripts, they are not needed to build.
  It should be part of the default Ubuntu install.
  If you use 3.4 you need to install the 'typing' library manually so we highly recommended using 3.5 or newer.
  To install the typing library in Python **3.4** run:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install typing
    ```
- One of these (they are mutually exclusive):
  - Mesa OpenGL ES 2
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libgles2-mesa-dev
    ```
  - [Arm Mali OpenGL ES 3.0 Emulator V3.0.2 (64 bit)](https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/graphics-development-tools/opengl-es-emulator/downloads)
    ```bash
    wget https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/downloads/open-gl-es-emulator/3.0.2/Mali_OpenGL_ES_Emulator-v3.0.2.g694a9-Linux-64bit.deb
    sudo dpkg -i Mali_OpenGL_ES_Emulator-v3.0.2.g694a9-Linux-64bit.deb
    ```
- DevIL (Developer's Image Library)
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libdevil-dev
    ```
- Assimp (Open Asset Import Library)
  Is now downloaded and build from source when needed. So its no longer necessary to run "sudo apt-get install libassimp-dev".
- Download the source from git.

It's also a good idea to read the introduction to the [FslBuild toolchain](./FslBuild_toolchain_readme.md)

## Simple setup

1. Start a terminal (ctrl+alt t) in the DemoFramework folder
2. Run the `prepare.sh` file located in the root of the framework folder to
   configure the necessary environment variables and paths.
   Please beware that the `prepare.sh` file requires the current working 
   directory to be the root of your demoframework folder to function 
   (which is also the folder it resides in).
    ```bash
    source prepare.sh
    ```

## To Compile all samples

1. Make sure that you performed the [simple setup].
2. Compile everything (a good rule of thumb for '--BuildThreads N' is number of cpu cores * 2)
    ```bash
    FslBuild.py -t sdk --BuildThreads 2
    ```

## To Compile and run an existing sample application

In this example we will utilize the GLES2.S06_Texturing app.

1. Make sure that you performed the [simple setup].
2. Change directory to the sample directory:
    ```bash
    cd DemoApps/GLES2/S06_Texturing
    ```
3. Compile the project (a good rule of thumb for '--BuildThreads N' is number of cpu cores * 2)
   If you FslBuild without the --BuildThreads argument it will be set to 'auto' which uses your cpu core count.
    ```bash
    FslBuild.py --BuildThreads 2
    ```

## To create a new GLES2 demo project named 'CoolNewDemo'

1. Make sure that you performed the [simple setup].
2. Change directory to the GLES2 sample directory:
    ```bash
    cd DemoApps/GLES2
    ```
3. Create the project template using the FslBuildNew.py script
    ```bash
    FslBuildNew.py GLES2 CoolNewDemo  
    ```
4. Change directory to the newly created project folder 'CoolNewDemo'
    ```bash
    cd CoolNewDemo
    ```
5. Compile the project (a good rule of thumb for '--BuildThreads N' is number of cpu cores * 2)
    ```bash
    FslBuild.py --BuildThreads 2
    ```

Note:

Once a build has been done once you can just invoke the make file directly.
However this requires that you didn't change any dependencies or add files.
To do this run:

  ```bash
  make -j 2
  ```

If you add source files to a project or change the Fsl.gen file then run the
`FslBuildGen.py` script in the project root folder to regenerate the various
build files or just make sure you always use the `FslBuild.py` script as it
automatically adds files and regenerate build files as needed.

## Building Vulkan demo framework apps

Install the Vulkan SDK, See the [official SDK guide](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/linux/getting_started.html)

1. Download the Vulkan sdk from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
2. Move the downloaded file to a sdk dir
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/vulkan
    mv vulkansdk-linux-x86_64-1.1.92.1.tar.gz ~/vulkan
    ```
3. Unpack it it
    ```bash
    cd ~/vulkan
    tar zxf vulkansdk-linux-x86_64-1.1.92.1.tar.gz
    ```
4. Install the necessary packages
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libglm-dev cmake libxcb-dri3-0 libxcb-present0 libpciaccess0 libpng-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-dri3-dev libx11-dev libmirclient-dev libwayland-dev libxrandr-dev libxcb-ewmh-dev
    ```
5. Setup the vulkan environment
    ```bash
    pushd ~/vulkan/1.1.92.1
    source setup-env.sh
    popd
    ```
6. Ensure that the LIBRARY_PATH is set for GCC
    ```bash
    export LIBRARY_PATH=$VULKAN_SDK/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
    ```
7. Run the normal setup.

## Building OpenCV 4.0 demo framework apps

1. Follow the normal setup procedure for the sdk
2. Install the required packages
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
    ```
3. Install the optional packages
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev
    ```
4. Create a sdk directory
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/sdk
    cd ~/sdk
    ```
5. Download the 4.0.1 release for ubuntu, unzip it, remove the download, enter the directory
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.0.1.zip
    unzip 4.0.1.zip
    rm 4.0.1.zip
    cd opencv-4.0.1
    ```
6. Build OpenCV
    ```bash
    mkdir release
    cd release
    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
    make -j $(nproc)
    sudo make install
    ```
7. Ensure that the OpenCV 4 headers are where they used to be
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/opencv4/opencv2/ /usr/local/include/opencv2
    ```
8. Ensure that you can locate the OpenCV .so files
    ```bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib"
    ```
9. Add a dependency to OpenCV to your "fsl.gen" file like this
    ```xml
    <Dependency Name="OpenCV3"/>
    ```
   See DemoApps/GLES2/OpenCV101/Fsl.gen for how its done.

10. Run FslBuildGen.py to regenerate the project files.

## Building OpenCL demo framework apps

- This is a guide that works for running inside a virtual machine.
  It will use the AMD OpenCL CPU implementation.
  If you encounter problems or want to use proper GPU accelleration please refer to AMD's guidelines.

1. Download the [AMD sdk](http://developer.amd.com/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/)
   (AMD APP SDK v2.9.1 beware the 3.0 release appears to be broken)
2. Go to the location of the downloaded file AMD-APP-SDK-linux-v2.9-1.599.381-GA-x64.tar.bz2
3. Extract the sdk (Follow the next three steps or look at the install guide)
    ```bash
    tar xvjf AMD-APP-SDK-linux-v2.9-1.599.381-GA-x64.tar.bz2
    ```
4. Remove the downloaded file
    ```bash
    rm AMD-APP-SDK-linux-v2.9-1.599.381-GA-x64.tar.bz2
    ```
5. Run the extracted script
    ```bash
    sudo ./AMD-APP-SDK-v2.9-1.599.381-GA-linux64.sh
    ```
6. Ensure that the environment variable AMDAPPSDKROOT is set (You might need to restart your terminal or logoff)
    ```bash
    printenv AMDAPPSDKROOT
    ```
7. You are now ready to build and run OpenCL apps.
